My daughter got a new board game called [Little Cooperation](http://amzn.to/2egNqvN). The goal of the game is, cooperatively, to move four animals from a fishing hole to their igloo.

After playing a bit I felt like more often that not we were losing. I started thinking about the ratio of win to loss for cooperative games and then I figured I could write a script to see what that was.

    > ./play.py
    ...
    > total games: 619,807
    > total wins: 293,502
    > win percentage: 47.4

For fun I changed the number of ice cubes to 7 (59.0%) and then 8 (69.3%).
